# Project Annuaire

This is a project I made for school.  
The interface is made with [customTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).
There is still a lot of bugs or unusable features, but I will improve the project if it's needed.

## File format
To save the phonebook, I created file format .annuaire ( annuaire = phonebook in french ).
In fact, it's just .zip archive renamed, wich contain :
1.  A list_contact.csv file, which contain all the informations of the contacts
1.  Pictures of the contacts  

I'm sure thinking this is not an optimal solution, so feel free to make suggestions !

## Installation
I don't tkink this project is the kind of project to be PyPi, but you can still clone the repo âœ…  
There is the code to install the requierments :
```
cd path/of/the/repos
pip install requirements.txt
```
